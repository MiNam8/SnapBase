### ðŸ“š Textbook Solution Storage Bot

#### ðŸš© Problem  
Searching for specific textbook problem solutions in Telegram chats was time-consuming and frustrating due to unorganized message history.

#### ðŸ’¡ Solution  
I developed a Telegram bot that stores and organizes solutions to textbook problems, eliminating the need to scroll through chat history. This made the process of finding solutions significantly more efficient and user-friendly.


#### UPD:
It turned out people don't even need my solution, since they mainly use AI models to solve problems now. I should have interviewed people firstly.
